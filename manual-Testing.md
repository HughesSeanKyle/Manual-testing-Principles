                        - - a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language 
                    - - Debuggers
                        - - A debugger is a program that allows you to step through another program one line at a time. This is very useful when trying to identify incorrect code
                    - - Interpreters
                        - - An interpreter translates code into machine code, instruction by instruction - the CPU executes each instruction before the interpreter moves on to translate the next instruction. Interpreted code will show an error as soon as it hits a problem, so it is easier to debug than compiled code.
                - - 3. Application Software

        - - 2. What is Software Testing? (17:30)
            - - In order to release a high quality product (software) to client
                - - testing must be done to ensure the product has little to no 
                    - - defects (bugs)
                - - Defects in a software can cause an unexpected behavior of 
                    - - the software. This unexpected behavior can lead to 
                        - - 1. A loss in revenue
                        - - 2. A loss in clientele

                        - - 4. A loss of competitive edge in the market
            - - Software Testing also forms part of the 
                - - Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC
                    - - 1. Get Software requirements from client
                    - - 2. Design the software based on requirements
                    - - 3. Development based of design and requirements 
                    - - 4. Testing the iterations of development 
                    - - 5. Deploy the software to the market 
                    - - 6. Review software based on live market behavior
                    - - 7. Ongoing maintenance 
                    - - 8. Adding new features in the future 
                        - - Repeat steps 1-7. 
            - - Further notes 
                - - Software testing is part of the development process. 
                    - - It is an activity to detect and identify the
                        - - defects in the software.
                    - - The objecttive of testing is to release a high quality 
                        - - product to the client. 

        - - 3. What is Software Quality? (26:05)
            - - To define quality in the digital arena we can define it 
                - - based to the metric of how well our piece of software is 
                    - - working. 
            - - Some metrics to evaluate quality are:
                - - 1. The Software is defect/bug-free
                - - 2. The software is delivered on time
                - - 3. The product is within the specified budget of client
                - - 4. It meets the requirement and/or expectation 
                - - 5. The software is maintainable 

        - - 4. Project vs Product? (32:20)
            - - Project
                - - If a software application is developed for a specific customer 
                    - - based on the requirement then it is called a Project
                        - - # Keywords
                            - - Customer requirements
                            - - Used only by customer orgnaization

            - - Product 
                - - If a software application is developed for multiple customers
                    - - based on market requirments then it is called a Product
                        - - # Keywords
                            - - Market requirements
                            - - Used by multiple market participants
                - - This will apply to google
                    - - google is a product based company and they ship software
                        - - for external users (i.e the market)
                    - - More examples include

                    - - Stakeholders 
                        - - Snr Designer
                        - - Design Engineer 
                        - - Testers 
                    - - The most senior designers in this case will 
                        - - create a blueprint of the software 
                        - - The blueprint will consist of 
                            - - 1. Sitemaps 
                            - - 2. Userflows 
                            - - 3. Wireframes 
                            - - 4. Moodboards 
                            - - 5. UI and UX research 
                        - - Testers will be part of user flow & prototype testing 
                            - - Testing in this phase will focus on 
                                - - usability as no code has been implemented yet
                - - 4. Building/Develoment/Implementation
                    - - Stakeholders 
                        - - Snr to Jnr Programmers 
                    - - In this phase, the database admin creates and imports the necessary data into the database. Programming languages are defined by requirements. Developers create the interface as per the coding guidelines and conduct unit testing. This is an important phase for developers. They need to be open-minded and flexible if any changes are introduced by the business analyst.  
                - - 5. Testing & Integration
                    - - Stakeholders
                        - - Testers, QA, Snr QA
                    - - Testers test the software against the requirements to make sure that the software is solving the needs addressed and outlined during the planning phase. All tests are conducted as functional testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and non-functional testing. 
                - - 6. Deployment & Maintenance
                    - - In a post-production, live software environment, the system is in maintenance mode. No matter the number of users, the sophistication of the software and rigorous QA testing, issues will occur. That’s the nature of software with managing data, integration, and security, and real world usage. Access to knowledgeable, reliable support resources is essential, as is routine maintenance and staying up to date on upgrades.
            - - Different companies might have different models that their 
                - - SDLC will iterate through 
                - - These models can be 
                    - - The waterfall, spiral or v-model and will be covered in 
                        - - depth in later models
