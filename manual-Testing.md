                - - perform a task 
            - - Types of software
                - - 1. System Software

                        - - a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".
                    - - Utilities

                    - - Compilers
                        - - a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language 
                    - - Debuggers
                        - - A debugger is a program that allows you to step through another program one line at a time. This is very useful when trying to identify incorrect code
                    - - Interpreters
                        - - An interpreter translates code into machine code, instruction by instruction - the CPU executes each instruction before the interpreter moves on to translate the next instruction. Interpreted code will show an error as soon as it hits a problem, so it is easier to debug than compiled code.
                - - 3. Application Software

        - - 2. What is Software Testing? (17:30)
            - - In order to release a high quality product (software) to client
                - - testing must be done to ensure the product has little to no 
                    - - defects (bugs)
                - - Defects in a software can cause an unexpected behavior of 
                    - - the software. This unexpected behavior can lead to 
                        - - 1. A loss in revenue
                        - - 2. A loss in clientele 
                        - - 3. Damaged client reputation 
                        - - 4. A loss of competitive edge in the market
            - - Software Testing also forms part of the 
                - - Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC
                    - - 1. Get Software requirements from client
                    - - 2. Design the software based on requirements
                    - - 3. Development based of design and requirements 
                    - - 4. Testing the iterations of development 
                    - - 5. Deploy the software to the market 
                    - - 6. Review software based on live market behavior
                    - - 7. Ongoing maintenance 
                    - - 8. Adding new features in the future 
                        - - Repeat steps 1-7. 
            - - Further notes 
                - - Software testing is part of the development process. 
                    - - It is an activity to detect and identify the
                        - - defects in the software.
                    - - The objecttive of testing is to release a high quality 
                        - - product to the client. 

        - - 3. What is Software Quality? (26:05)
            - - To define quality in the digital arena we can define it 
                - - based to the metric of how well our piece of software is 
                    - - working. 
            - - Some metrics to evaluate quality are:
                - - 1. The Software is defect/bug-free
                - - 2. The software is delivered on time
                - - 3. The product is within the specified budget of client
                - - 4. It meets the requirement and/or expectation 
                - - 5. The software is maintainable 

        - - 4. Project vs Product? (32:20)
            - - Project
                - - If a software application is developed for a specific customer 
                    - - based on the requirement then it is called a Project
                        - - # Keywords
                            - - Customer requirements
                            - - Used only by customer orgnaization
                - - Most of the time this will be applicable to service based 
                    - - companies
                    - - This software is shipped for internal users 
                        - - e.g
                            - - employees
                                - - clerks, managers, finance/admin personel 
            - - Product 
                - - If a software application is developed for multiple customers
                    - - based on market requirments then it is called a Product
                        - - # Keywords
                            - - Market requirements
                            - - Used by multiple market participants
                - - This will apply to google
                    - - google is a product based company and they ship software
                        - - for external users (i.e the market)
                    - - More examples include
                        - - Facebook
                        - - Microsoft 
                        - - Apple

                - - 4. Reduced Brand Reputation. 

        - - 6. Error, Bug & Failure (39:40)
            - - Error
                - - An error is a mistake made by a human that leads to
                    - - a discrepancy between the actual and the expected result

                - - Environment
                    - - Development
            - - Bug
                - - A bug is a flaw in a software system that causes the

                - - Environment
                    - - Testing and Production  

            - - Failure
                - - A failure is the inability of a software system to perform
                    - - its operations within the specified performance benchmark.

                - - Environment
                    - - Testing and Production  

        - - 7. Why does the software have bugs? (44:45)
            - - 1. Miscommunication or no communication
                - - Developer will implement
                    - - Tester might expect something else
                - - Developer might develop outside requirement scope 
                - - Tester might not test correct scope  
            - - 2. Software Complexity
                - - Many stakeholders involved in building the software
                    - - over a long period  
            - - 3. Programming Errors 
            - - 4. Changing Requirements 
            - - 5. Lack of Skilled Testers
