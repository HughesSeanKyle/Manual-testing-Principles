        - - 2. What is Software Testing? (17:30)
            - - In order to release a high quality product (software) to client
                - - testing must be done to ensure the product has little to no 
                    - - defects (bugs)
                - - Defects in a software can cause an unexpected behavior of 
                    - - the software. This unexpected behavior can lead to 
                        - - 1. A loss in revenue
                        - - 2. A loss in clientele

                        - - 4. A loss of competitive edge in the market
            - - Software Testing also forms part of the 
                - - Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC
                    - - 1. Get Software requirements from client
                    - - 2. Design the software based on requirements
                    - - 3. Development based of design and requirements 
                    - - 4. Testing the iterations of development 
                    - - 5. Deploy the software to the market 
                    - - 6. Review software based on live market behavior

                    - - 8. Adding new features in the future 
                        - - Repeat steps 1-7. 
            - - Further notes 
                - - Software testing is part of the development process. 
                    - - It is an activity to detect and identify the
                        - - defects in the software.
                    - - The objecttive of testing is to release a high quality 
                        - - product to the client. 

        - - 3. What is Software Quality? (26:05)
            - - To define quality in the digital arena we can define it 
                - - based to the metric of how well our piece of software is 
                    - - working. 
            - - Some metrics to evaluate quality are:
                - - 1. The Software is defect/bug-free
                - - 2. The software is delivered on time
                - - 3. The product is within the specified budget of client
                - - 4. It meets the requirement and/or expectation 
                - - 5. The software is maintainable 

        - - 4. Project vs Product? (32:20)
            - - Project
                - - If a software application is developed for a specific customer 
                    - - based on the requirement then it is called a Project
                        - - # Keywords
                            - - Customer requirements
                            - - Used only by customer orgnaization

            - - Product 
                - - If a software application is developed for multiple customers
                    - - based on market requirments then it is called a Product
                        - - # Keywords
                            - - Market requirements
                            - - Used by multiple market participants
                - - This will apply to google
                    - - google is a product based company and they ship software
                        - - for external users (i.e the market)
                    - - More examples include

                        - - Design Engineer 
                        - - Testers 
                    - - The most senior designers in this case will 
                        - - create a blueprint of the software 
                        - - The blueprint will consist of 
                            - - 1. Sitemaps 
                            - - 2. Userflows

                - - 4. Building/Develoment/Implementation
                    - - Stakeholders 
                        - - Snr to Jnr Programmers 
                    - - In this phase, the database admin creates and imports the necessary data into the database. Programming languages are defined by requirements. Developers create the interface as per the coding guidelines and conduct unit testing. This is an important phase for developers. They need to be open-minded and flexible if any changes are introduced by the business analyst.  
                - - 5. Testing & Integration
                    - - Stakeholders
                        - - Testers, QA, Snr QA
                    - - Testers test the software against the requirements to make sure that the software is solving the needs addressed and outlined during the planning phase. All tests are conducted as functional testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and non-functional testing. 
                - - 6. Deployment & Maintenance
                    - - In a post-production, live software environment, the system is in maintenance mode. No matter the number of users, the sophistication of the software and rigorous QA testing, issues will occur. That’s the nature of software with managing data, integration, and security, and real world usage. Access to knowledgeable, reliable support resources is essential, as is routine maintenance and staying up to date on upgrades.
            - - Different companies might have different models that their 
                - - SDLC will iterate through 
                - - These models can be 
                    - - The waterfall, spiral or v-model and will be covered in 
                        - - depth in later models

                                    - - When client starts using the software the maintenance phase then kicks in 
            - - This is a much older and traditional model 
            - - Also known as a linear model 

            - - How is software developed in the waterfall model? 
                - - In this model every subsequent phase depends on the previous 
                    - - phase in the model. 
                - - If one phase is not completed then we cannot continue
                    - - onto the next phase 
            - - When to use SDLC Waterfall Model?
                - - Requirements are not changing frequently
                - - Application is not complicated and big
                - - Project is short
                - - Requirement is clear
                - - Environment is stable
                - - Technology and tools used are not dynamic and is stable
                - - Resources are available and trained
            - - Advantages and Disadvantages of Waterfall Model
                - - Advantages 
                    - - Before the next phase of development, each phase must be completed
                    - - Suited for smaller projects where requirements are well defined
                    - - They should perform quality assurance test (Verification and Validation) before completing each stage
                    - - Elaborate documentation is done at every phase of the software’s development cycle
                    - - Project is completely dependent on project team with minimum client intervention
                    - - Any changes in software is made during the process of the development
                - - Disadvantages 
                    - - Error can be fixed only during the phase
                    - - It is not desirable for complex project where requirement changes frequently
                    - - Testing period comes quite late in the developmental process
                    - - Documentation occupies a lot of time of developers and testers
                    - - Clients valuable feedback cannot be included with ongoing development phase
                    - - Small changes or errors that arise in the completed software may cause a lot of problems
